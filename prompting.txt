So let me give a detailed functionality description of how I want the DocumentProcessFlow to work. The DocumentProcessFlow is a component
that exists as a standalone but within a context of 2 HOCs, that is the ContentBuilder, 
and DocumentGenerator. It is a set of tabs that controls the direction of where a document should go.

so the DocumentProcessFlow component consists of 5 major tabs, the ['to', 'from', 'through', 'cc', 'approvers]
the to, from and through state is of type TemplateProcessProps, and the cc and approvers are of type TemplateProcessProps[]
you can check the useTemplateHeader for reference. 

The idea behind this is in the context of the ContentBuilder, all tabs should be accessible because the idea is the administrator designs the general workflow
but then in the context of the DocumentGenerator, the user only sees the tabs that the stage and group has data. This is used to transform the configState to a workflow - trackers data
This is what you have done earlier.

Let this component have access to the global state and mutate it directly, minimise prop drilling, and too much re-rendering. Make sure the state on each tab persists on every render.
